\section{Future work}

We saw that just giving noise repeatedly is not effective. 
Here we suggest two further approaches. 


\begin{itemize}
\item
Gradual noise

Start with a large noise and decrease it gradually until the sum of all the noises is less than 1.
For now we're adding noise to unstable edges. 
The more edges being marked as unstable, the smaller each noise gets, which doesn't make much difference when it is applied. 
To deal with this problem, by adding a large noise, we move the routine to some state, then by removing previous noise and assigning smaller noise, we get the right solution.


\item
BP-Hungarian algorithm

As figure~\ref{fig:sum_v_iter} shows BP is good at brining the state near to the optima. By applying Hungarian algorithm from the state BP made, we can get the advantages from both. 
Hungarian algorithm doesn't have the convergence issue with multiple optima. 



\end{itemize}
