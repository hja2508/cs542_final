\section{Conclusions}

%We identified several limitations in existing optimization algorithms. 
We idntified the limitation in existing optimization algorithms that they're structurally not parallelizable. We used BP, a message passing machine learnng algorithm has parallel structure, to solve the MWM problem in distributed environment. 

The abstraction uses a \textbf{data graph} as a computational model. Updates are done with the local computation on each vertex. Parallel \textbf{scheduler} manages the scheduling of dynamic iterative parallel computation.  

To manage the task/graph assignment, scheduler and faults we used ZooKeeper, the service enables easier management of distributed configuration and synchronization. 

Since ZooKeeper makes dns-based assignment, the load balancing still remains challenging.
