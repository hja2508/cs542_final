\section{Conclusions}

%We identified several limitations in existing optimization algorithms. 
We idntified the limitation in existing optimization algorithms that they're structurally not parallelizable. We used BP, a message passing machine learnng algorithm has parallel structure, to solve the MWM problem in distributed environment. 

We had two major challenges: speedup and multiple optima. For speedup, we initialized messages to half of their edge weights. And for multiple optima, we are using noise temporally to make the routine converge. 

The algorithm worked pretty well on the ramdom dataset, but still have some problems with realistic dataset. We leave further approaches to future work.
